........................prerequisites for running Simulations..............................


Please go through the "Readme.txt" files given in all the subfolders for a better understanding of codes and output.

Each subfolder contains the file named "(Folder Name).pdf" in which the final srccode(Source Code or Main Code) is written and the output is shown with description.

With the same name as the pdf file, a ".m" file is given in which the srccode is written and can be run in MATLAB.

Other files in folders required function files or the saved workspace file.

Please ensure that your MATLAB has already installed the "Peter Corke Robotic System Toolbox" cause many functions are used from the toolbox.

To check whether the toolbox is installed or not simply write the "rtbdemo" in the command window if the pop up opens than it's installed else go to the following website "https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/" and download the "RTB10.4.mltbx" file and run into your MATLAB.

All the values of the particular variable can be changed except the DH-Parameter which describes the configuration of the manipulators. Before changing the values make sure you know what you are doing cause many things will be running at the same time and if your get stuck anywhere it would be hard to debug it or just run it as it is and flex on your friends ;);).



...........................(i) Eular_Simulink_Model.................................


In this folder, a file name "KR3_Euler_Simulink_Model.pdf" contains the published documentation, the srccode, and output.

The main srccode file is "Eular_Final_Model.m" in which the final srccode for Simulink simulations is written.

"Circle.csv" and "Trianguler_Piramid.csv" files contain the coordinates in a table form generated from the Solidworks.

"ConversionC.m(Contains the Circular Path)" and " ConversionP.m(Contains the Pyramid shape.)" is a function used for the conversion needed when the coordinate file is called into MATLAB. It converts the data set of coordinates from table to array form.

"geo_sol.m" is the geometric solution of the KUKA KR3 which is derived by hand on pen & paper.

"ikine_Num.m" contains the "fsolve(an inbuilt function in MATLAB for solving the non-linear equations)" equations in which a numerical iterative method is used to solve the inverse kinematics of the task space points.

"trajectory.m" a quintic polynomial or a 5th order polynomial is used to generate a smoother trajectory between the given points.

"trimtheta.m" is one type of filter used to avoid the collision of joints during the simulation cause, in reality, they should not collide with each other. It simply converts the quadrant of particular joint angles. or it simply limits the joint angles if it's going out of its joint limit.

"Simscape_Model_ver_3.slx" the main Simulink file. Simulink model can be open separately by running this file or it will automatically open when the srccode("Eular_Final_Model.m") is run.

Simulink allows us to replicate the outside environment in which manipulators will be used. The Simulink model is can be generated by either importing the assembly of the manipulators or generating the mechanical circuit manually.

After it opens, simply press cntrl+D to update and compile the Simulink model.
After it gets compiled, a window will open containing the manipulator. Then simply press the cntrl+T or play button in the window to run the simulation.

You may face the problem when the Simulink model is compiled which will be probably a simple file path error cause when the Simulink model is generated the ".step" of a particular joint is given manually using a particular path.

To solve that error simply open the KR3 Simulink model and you will see the block for each manipulator's joints. Open those each manipulator joints block one by one. In them you will see a block for a solid body, open that and change the file path for each solid part respectively. Choose the given ".step" file in the same folder. It should solve the error while compilation.
